# explore-yaml

A project to explore all about yaml files so that it will help me implement ci-cd for our databricks workspace via azure devops.

## TODO:

[] Have a root file
[] Create several nested folders.  
[] Have few dummy yaml files.
[] Write a program that finds all the .yml or .yaml files and converts them from yaml to tabular format.
